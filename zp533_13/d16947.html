Is it the perfectly chosen paint colors? The moldings the archways or the beams? Is it the matching nightstands the puddled curtains the tiled bathrooms the oak-plank floors? For years shelter magazines and design books defined a home that was worth having?and by extension a home that was worth showing off to the world?as one that was decorated just so that paid attention to those kinds of details and that was often brought to life by someone with professional expertise in such matters. And while those homes were often beautiful they sometimes evoked an uneasy sense of anonymity; you got the same feeling from looking at them as you did from flipping through the catalog of a big-box furniture store. You wondered “Who exactly lives here?”<br>When we founded our online magazine Sight Unseen more than a decade ago?with the mission to provide readers with a highly personal look at design objects and the creative people behind them? we made a conscious decision to approach interiors from a radically different point of view. We believed and still do that while layout and fixtures and fabrics can all play a part in making a space aesthetically pleasing it"s the objects you surround yourself with that truly give your home its soul: the vintage Danish chair you found at a flea market the indigo vase you bought from an LA ceramicist the candlesticks a friend brought back from Mexico the side table you"ve been saving up to buy from a designer you follow on Instagram. These objects are the story you tell to the world about your personality and your obsessions your experiences and your memories your desires and your intentions. Infused with your personal narrative they provide a catalyst for conversation when friends visit (or virtually view) your home and a comfort for when you’re cooped up inside as so many of us were in recent years. <br>At the start of 2020 three weeks into quarantine we got an email from a literary agent in New York asking if we might be interested in writing a book; Stuck at home people were looking for inspiration and new ways to think about their interiors. A Sight Unseen book was something we"d thought about?and been asked about?for years but had never pursued partly because the idea of ??putting together a compendium of our past stories or our favorite homes and design studios never really felt momentous enough for us. But the pandemic brought us a whole new perspective. When we thought about what we were collectively going through at the time and how our objects were such a huge source of comfort in isolation it became clear that we had to write this book: <br>How to Live with Objects<br>  a comprehensive guide to incorporating meaningful works of art and design into your home. The book would be expansive enough that its ideas could remain relevant for years to come and it would allow us to combine all of our interests and everything we’d learned over the course of our careers into a single volume. The idea that you should accumulate not decorate. The idea that opposing forces like contemporary and vintage ought to live in harmony in your space. The idea that it’s okay to think about your home not as something to be completed but as a forever work in progress in the same way that you yourself probably are. Plus everything you"ve always wanted to know about objects: why they"re important who makes them what makes them valuable how to acquire them and ultimately how to put them together in a way that"s warm inviting and extremely personal?without a hefty budget or the help of an interior designer or decorator. <br>These ideas have always felt personal to us because it was objects that paved the way for our interest in design. Neither of us studied design in school?we’re both trained as journalists? but both of us had formal experiences with design by way of the domestic items we grew up with. When Jill looks back on her suburban Midwestern childhood she remembers the tulip-patterned Marimekko sheets the wooden highboy engraved with yellow flowers the lamp depicting a unicorn resting in a garden and the sofa embroidered with tropical flowers. Monica growing up in Ohio actually lived with some design classics like Breuer’s Cesca and Wassily chairs. But as a lover of all things colorful and sparkly her bedroom as a five-year-old consisted of wild Memphis-style sheets and a funny collection of Swarovski crystal animals that her dad brought her each time he came home from a work trip. These objects remain firmly implanted in our memories and represent the first time we experienced a strong emotional connection to our physical environment. <br>As a child when you live with things someone else has chosen for you you either don’t feel anything for them at all or you ascribe meaning to them via your imagination. Things also tend to hold more meaning when they act as your introduction to something which is why your favorite album is often the first one you heard by that band or why your firs<br><br>【発送方法】<br>こちらの商品はご注文後に海外からお取り寄せいたしますので、お届けまでに2週間から4週間程度のお時間をいただいております。最大で1か月ほどかかる場合がございますので、お急ぎの方はご購入をお控えいただけますようお願いいたします。ご注文後、弊社の国内配送センターへ取り寄せ、検品・再梱包を行い、「レターパック」または「クリックポスト」にてお客様へ発送いたします。<br><br>【キャンセル商品】<br>ご注文後はリアルタイムで海外へ発注が行われますため、原則としてキャンセルはお受けできません。ご注文の際には十分にご確認の上、お手続きくださいますようお願い申し上げます。<br><br>【在庫切れ・遅延の場合】<br>1か月以上の遅延やメーカーの在庫切れなどが発生した場合には、必ずメールにてご連絡の上、当店からキャンセルさせていただきます。ご注文から1か月を超えても当店からの連絡がないまま放置されることはございませんので、ご安心ください。<br><br>【発送準備中】<br>メーカーから商品を手配中の際は【発送準備中】と表示されます。問題なく商品の手配・発送準備が進んでおりますので、どうぞご安心ください。最大で1か月まで【発送準備中】と表示される場合がございます。<br/><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/magicdoor_9780593235041_i_20240709045439" />
